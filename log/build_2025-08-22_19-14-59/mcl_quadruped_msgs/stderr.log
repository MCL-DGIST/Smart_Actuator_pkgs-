  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "python_cmake_module" with any of the following names:

    python_cmake_moduleConfig.cmake
    python_cmake_module-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "python_cmake_module" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "python_cmake_module_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "python_cmake_module" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
